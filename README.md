- 👋 Hi, I’m @orgarcia-cs; otherwise known as Oscar.
- 👀 I’m interested in neural network modeling and applying different mathematics beyond the conventional differential equations; in particular, fractal geometry.
- 🌱 I’m currently examining how resonant networks (Boltzmann networks in full feedback) oscillate and respond to time chained inputs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... well just about anything but I have a particular fondness for graphics programming and text processing.
- 🧬🧬  I'm decent in C/C++, pretty basic in Java and Python and pretty conversant in reading electrical and mechanical diagrams and the Atmel chipset.
- 📫 If you feel like talking about programming I can be reached at oscar_r_garcia@yahoo.com.
